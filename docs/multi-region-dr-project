# Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Architecture on AWS

## Project Summary
This project deploys a simple web application in two AWS Regions:
- Primary Region: `us-east-1`
- Standby Region: `us-west-2`

It implements automated DNS failover, cross-region data replication, and repeatable infrastructure provisioning via CloudFormation.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- High availability architecture patterns
- Disaster recovery planning and testing
- Multi-region deployment strategy
- Backup and replication controls
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using nested CloudFormation templates

## AWS Services Used
- `EC2` and `Auto Scaling` for app compute
- `Application Load Balancer` for traffic distribution
- `RDS MySQL` primary + cross-region read replica
- `Route 53` failover policy and health checks
- `S3` cross-region replication for static/backup objects
- `CloudFormation` for modular, repeatable infrastructure
- `CloudWatch` for health and failover visibility

## Target Architecture
- VPC in each region with public/private subnets across 2 AZs
- Web tier in public subnets behind ALB
- Database tier in private subnets
- Route 53 record with PRIMARY and SECONDARY endpoints
- S3 bucket pair with CRR (source in primary, destination in standby)
- Standby compute set to warm standby (1 instance min) by default

## Security Controls
- Least-privilege IAM roles for EC2, CloudFormation, and replication
- DB subnet groups and private subnet isolation
- Security groups allowing only required app/db ports
- Encryption at rest (RDS + S3) and in transit (HTTPS)
- CloudWatch alarms for health check failures and replication lag
