# DR Test Results

## Scope
- Project: `drp-683707-20260215b`
- Primary region: `us-east-1`
- Secondary region: `us-west-2`
- Record: `project.dr.internal` (private hosted zone failover)

## Drill Method
1. Scaled primary ASG to zero (`min=0`, `desired=0`).
2. Monitored:
   - Route 53 health check: `96a7a218-7e29-407d-a14d-2a307c55c76d`
   - Primary ALB HTTP status
   - Secondary ALB HTTP status
3. Restored primary ASG to normal (`min=2`, `desired=2`, `max=4`).

## Key Timestamps (UTC)
- Drill start: `2026-02-15T21:49:16Z`
- Primary endpoint first down (`503`): `2026-02-15T21:49:37Z`
- Route 53 health check first unhealthy: `2026-02-15T21:50:52Z`
- Primary recovery confirmed (`200` + health-check success): `2026-02-15T21:54:14Z`

## Metrics
- Detection time: `96 seconds`
- Estimated failover time with TTL (`60s`): `156 seconds` (`2m 36s`)
- RPO observation: `0 seconds` (`ReplicaLag` metric remained `0`)
