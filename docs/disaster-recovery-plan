# Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

--- Executive Summary

This Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) defines the strategy, architecture, and operational procedures for ensuring business continuity of a cloud-hosted web application deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
The architecture leverages multi-region high availability, automated DNS failover, cross-region data replication, and infrastructure-as-code automation to minimize downtime and data loss during regional failures.

This plan ensures:

- High availability
- Automated disaster recovery
- Minimal operational intervention

--- Business Objectives

### Objectives & Target 

~ Service Availability - 99.99% 
~ Maximum Downtime (RTO) - ≤ 10 minutes 
~ Maximum Data Loss (RPO) - ≤ 1 minute 
~ Recovery Mode - Automated 
~ Manual Intervention - Minimal 

--- Scope

This plan covers:

- Web application hosted on EC2
- Database services hosted on Amazon RDS
- Static and object data hosted on Amazon S3
- DNS routing and traffic management via Amazon Route 53
- Infrastructure deployment via AWS CloudFormation

--- Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario ~ Impact ~ Recovery Strategy 

* AWS regional outage ~ Total service loss ~ DNS failover to standby region 
* Primary database failure ~ Application outage ~ Promote cross-region read replica 
* EC2 fleet failure ~ Service degradation ~ Auto Scaling group self-healing 
* Data corruption ~ Data integrity loss ~ Restore from backups 
* Network outage ~ Traffic disruption ~ Route 53 DNS rerouting 

--- Architecture Overview

### Regions

Role & AWS Region 

- Primary ~ us-east-1 
- Standby ~ us-west-2 

### Core Services

- Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Amazon RDS with cross-region replication
- Amazon S3 with cross-region replication
- Amazon Route 53 with health checks and failover routing
- AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure automation

--- Recovery Strategy

### DNS Failover

- Route 53 monitors health of the primary Application Load Balancer.
- If the primary region becomes unhealthy:
  - DNS records automatically fail over to the standby region.
  - End users are redirected with no manual intervention.

### Database Recovery

- Primary RDS instance runs in us-east-1.
- Continuous replication is maintained to a read replica in us-west-2.
- During disaster:
  - Replica is promoted to primary.
  - Application configuration is updated to point to new endpoint.

### Storage Recovery

- S3 Cross-Region Replication synchronizes data continuously.
- During disaster standby bucket becomes primary data source.

--- Backup Strategy

### Resource ~ Backup Method  

- RDS ~ Automated snapshots  
- S3 ~ Versioning + CRR 
- EC2 ~ Infrastructure-as-code rebuild  
- CloudFormation ~ Template version control  

--- Recovery Metrics

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- Component ~ Recovery Time 

- DNS Failover ~ 1–2 minutes 
- Database Promotion ~ 3–5 minutes 
- Total System Recovery ~ ≤ 10 minutes 

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- Component ~ Data Loss 

- RDS Replication ~ < 5 seconds 
- S3 Replication ~ Near-zero
